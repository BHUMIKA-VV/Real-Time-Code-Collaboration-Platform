# 🚀 Real-Time Code Collaboration Platform

A **mini Google Docs clone for code editing** built with **Java (Spring Boot) + React + WebSockets + PostgreSQL**.  
It allows multiple users to edit the same document **in real-time**, with authentication, version history, and cloud deployment.

## 🎯 Why This Project?
- Real-world relevance → Companies like Google, Microsoft use similar tech.  
- Covers **Java, Cloud, DevOps** → matches industry demand.  
- Shows **system design thinking** → concurrency, scaling, collaboration.  
- Demo-ready → you can screen-share in interviews.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot, WebSockets, JWT, JPA  
- **Frontend:** React, Monaco Editor (VS Code’s editor)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (document storage + versioning)  
- **DevOps:** Docker, AWS (EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
   React (Monaco Editor)
          │
   WebSocket + REST APIs
          │
   Spring Boot Backend
          │
   PostgreSQL Database
```

- **WebSocket** → for real-time collaboration  
- **REST APIs** → for CRUD operations (create/read/update documents)  
- **JWT Auth** → secure multi-user collaboration  
- **Versioning** → stores edit history

## 🏆 How to Explain in Interviews
💬 *“I built a real-time code collaboration tool inspired by Google Docs. Multiple users can edit code together using WebSockets in Java Spring Boot. I used PostgreSQL for persistence, React + Monaco Editor for the UI, and deployed it on AWS using Docker. This project helped me learn concurrency handling, cloud deployment, and system design.”*

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Syntax highlighting per language  
- Chat feature inside documents  
- Load balancing with multiple backend instances  
- CRDT/OT algorithm for conflict resolution
